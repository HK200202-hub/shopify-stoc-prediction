# Shopify Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM

This project trains an LSTM-based neural network to predict Shopify (SHOP) stock prices using historical price data and technical indicators.

The model uses:
- Price history
- EMA (12, 26)
- MACD
- RSI
- Volatility (7-day)
- 60-day lookback window

Final output:
- Future price predictions
- Performance evaluation
- Actual vs Predicted plot
